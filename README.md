### Implement a queue using two stacks

A stack is a data structure where items can be added to a collection and removed from it just like in a queue, except the difference is the order in which they are removed. In a stack, the last item added will be the first item removed (last in, first out). Stacks usually have two basic methods, push, which adds an item into the stack, and pop, which "pops off" the top item from the stack. 

Queue is a linear data structure where the first element is inserted from one end called REAR and deleted from the other end called as FRONT. ... In a queue, one end is always used to insert data (enqueue) and the other is used to delete data (dequeue), because queue is open at both its ends.

### Implement linkedlist within javascript

A linked list is an ordered collection of data elements. A data element can be represented as a node in a linked list. Each node consists of two parts: data & pointer to the next node.

Unlike arrays, data elements are not stored at contiguous locations. The data elements or nodes are linked using pointers, hence called a linked list.

A linked list has the following properties:

- Successive nodes are connected by pointers.
- The last node points to null.
- A head pointer is maintained which points to the first node of the list.
- A linked list can grow and shrink in size during execution of the program.
- It can be made just as long as required.
- It allocates memory as the list grows. Unlike arrays, which have a fixed size. Therefore, the upper limit on the number of elements must be known in advance. Generally, the allocated memory is equal to the upper limit irrespective of the usage. This is one the key advantages of using a linked list over an array.
- In contrast to an array, which stores data contiguously in memory, a linked list can easily insert or remove nodes from the list without reorganization of the entire data structure.
