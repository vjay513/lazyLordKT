### Implement a queue using two stacks

A stack is a data structure where items can be added to a collection and removed from it just like in a queue, except the difference is the order in which they are removed. In a stack, the last item added will be the first item removed (last in, first out). Stacks usually have two basic methods, push, which adds an item into the stack, and pop, which "pops off" the top item from the stack. 

Queue is a linear data structure where the first element is inserted from one end called REAR and deleted from the other end called as FRONT. ... In a queue, one end is always used to insert data (enqueue) and the other is used to delete data (dequeue), because queue is open at both its ends.
